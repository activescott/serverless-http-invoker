# serverless-http-invoker

Locally invoke [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) functions via their HTTP event as specified in Serverless.yml.

It makes it easy to test not only your handler logic, but also ensures that you have your http events setup properly in serverless.yml without deploying.

## Usage / Quick Start

Use it in tests of Serverless functions to test your HTTP endpoints along with the handler code. For example, you can write the following to test a Serverless function:

    it('should invoke simple path', function () {
      let response = invoker.invoke('GET api/hello')
      return expect(response).to.eventually.have.property('statusCode', 200)
    })

The test above is a test of a Serverless function defined in Serverless.yml as follows:

    functions:
      hello:
        handler: handler.hello
        events:
          - http:
              path: api/hello
              method: get

Many more examples and exaustive list of what is supported in [the tests](https://github.com/activescott/serverless-http-invoker/blob/master/test/test.js). Some additional real-world examples are demonstrated in the [sheetmonkey-server project](https://github.com/activescott/sheetmonkey-server). See [PluginsHandler.js](https://github.com/activescott/sheetmonkey-server/blob/master/server/test/PluginsHandler.js) and [PluginAuthHandler.js](https://github.com/activescott/sheetmonkey-server/blob/master/server/test/PluginAuthHandler.js) among others.

## Prerequisites / Usage Requirements

Requires Node.js latest, LTS, or v6 ([tested](https://travis-ci.org/activescott/serverless-http-invoker)).

Requires Serverless Framework v1.x.
If you are new to the Serverless Framework, check out the [Serverless Framework Getting Started Guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/).

## Install

yarn (`yarn add serverless-http-invoker --dev`) or npm (`npm install serverless-http-invoker --save-dev`)

## Features

- Simple to reference your handler
- Tests the serverless route is configured in serverless.yml as well as your handler code
- Test Framework agnostic (mocha, jest, etc.)

## Deploying to NPM

To deploy a pre-release version to NPM, tag a commit in master branch with a semver-compatible git tag prefixed with a v and POSTFIXED with an NPM distribution tag. For example:

    git tag v1.0.1-beta

To deploy a production version to NPM, tag a commit in master branch with a semver-compatible git tag prefixed with a v and WITHOUT a NPM distribution tag. For example:

    git tag v1.0.1

In this case, since no NPM distribution tag is provided the `latest` tag will be used making it a normal production release.
